# RiboSeq-Analysis

Analysis of Ribosome Profiling and RNA sequence data for virus infections of host cells.

November 2017.

Overview:

    Quality assessment of data.
    Trim reads.
    Map sequentially to rRNA; vRNA; mRNA; ncRNA; host genome.
    Plot mapping statistics.
    Calculate the length distribution of virus and mRNA-mapping reads + plot.
    Calculate framing of reads on virus and host mRNA transcripts + plot.
    Assess contamination of samples by ribonucleoproteins (RNPs).
    Host cell differential gene expression.
    GO term enrichment.
